## 📖 Project Overview
**ISS Sentinel** is a real-time computer vision system designed to automatically detect and classify **7 critical safety assets** inside the International Space Station (ISS).

Trained entirely on synthetic data generated by the **Falcon (Duality AI)** platform, the model overcomes challenges like occlusion and low-light environments. To demonstrate real-world utility, the model is deployed via a **Flask Web Dashboard**, allowing astronauts to upload inspection images and receive instant safety audits.

**Target Objects:**
`OxygenTank` | `NitrogenTank` | `FirstAidBox` | `FireExtinguisher` | `SafetySwitchPanel` | `FireAlarm` | `EmergencyPhone`

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
* **AI Model:** YOLOv8 Nano (Ultralytics) - *Chosen for high-speed edge inference.*
* **Training Hardware:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050 (4GB VRAM).
* **Backend Framework:** Python Flask.
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom "Dark Mode" Space Theme).
* **Data Source:** Synthetic Digital Twin Data (Falcon).

## 📊 Performance Metrics
Our model achieved high precision on the unseen test dataset:

* **mAP@0.5 Score:** **[INSERT YOUR FINAL SCORE, e.g. 0.892]**
* **Training Epochs:** 50
* **Batch Size:** 8

cd app

python app.py

cd training
python train.py

Challenges and their Solutions:
Hardware Constraints: We optimized the batch size to 8 to train efficiently on consumer-grade GPUs (RTX 2050) without memory crashes.

Occlusion Handling: Adjusted the confidence threshold to 0.25 to ensure the model detects safety objects even when partially hidden behind station machinery.

Sim-to-Real Gap: We utilized a robust Transfer Learning approach to adapt the model to the synthetic textures of the Falcon simulation.
